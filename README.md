<b>Summary:</b>
I combined several datasets to answer the question - where should someone live in Chicago if they want to find a cheap apartment near a lot of bars?
<ul>
  <li>I scraped Craigslist ads for apartments and filtered them based on location, cost, and proximity to public transit.</li>
  <li>I used the Foursquare API to get information about nearby businesses (specifically bars).</li>
  <li>Then I combined the information on a map and analyzed the results filtered by train stop.</li></ul>
It was a fun project and while the rental market is constantly changing I think the information is still valuable.
<br>Feel free to check it out!
