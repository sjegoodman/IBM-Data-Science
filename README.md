Summary:
I combined several datasets to answer the question - where should someone live in Chicago if they want to find a cheap apartment near a lot of bars?
<br>I scraped Craigslist ads for apartments and filtered them based on location, cost, and proximity to public transit.
<br>I used the Foursquare API to get information about nearby businesses (specifically bars).
<br>Then I combined the information on a map and analyzed the results filtered by train stop.
<br>It was a fun project and while the rental market is constantly changing I think the information is still valuable.
<br>Feel free to check it out!
